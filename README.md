## PolyGP with scikit-learn

**Latest update 1/1/2024**

This repository hosts my experiments using _polygp_, the library of Python functions I created to build an optimized Gaussian process regression polynomial kernel.  

A brief description of this work and references to previous/past work can be fould [here](https://alessiot.github.io/dsprojects/...).

The library _polygp_ is based on the [Gaussian process kernels](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/gaussian_process.html) from _scikit-learn_ and the optimization package [_optuna_](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).

The structure of this repository is the following:

polygp-sklearn/

├── polygp/ [the polygp source code for the package _polygp_]

├── notebooks/ [set of notebooks using _polygp_]

*Future plan: work with other packages other than scikit-learn.*
